# wirelessnetworksJANUS
Final Project for Wireless Sensor Networks class. Implementing JANUS in Omnet ++

Attached is our simulation code for implementing the JANUS underwater protocol in omnetpp. We have split it up into 3 modules, an AP, Sensor node, and an underwater wireless channel. 


Breakdown of Tasks:
The vast majority of the work was very much a group effort. Most of the coding was done in a peer coding style, switching off between one person coding and the other error checking.
